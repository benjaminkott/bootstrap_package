Bootstrap Package was built to be as adjustable as possible, so nothing is fixed
and everything can be configured through settings. The settings are grouped into
logical categories and can be modified in the site configuration.

Bootstrap Package provides multiple Site Sets that can be used individually or
combined. The "Full Package" set includes all features for a quick start.
