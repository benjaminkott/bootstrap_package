==================================================
Bootstrap Package
==================================================

This TYPO3 CMS >= 6.2 extension delivers a fully configured frontend based on the
Bootstrap CSS Framework and functions basically as a THEME for TYPO3CMS.

The goal of this package is to give an advanced example of how modern templating
in TYPO3 CMS can be handled nicely without depending on third party extensions.
Bootstrap Package is built on top of CSS_STYLED_CONTENT >= 6.2 and comes with a
fully configurable Frontend via TypoScript. This includes the TypoScript Constant
Editor.
