Bootstrap Package
==================================================

Bootstrap Package delivers a full configured frontend
theme for TYPO3, based on the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

The goal of this package is to give an advanced example of how modern templating
in TYPO3 CMS can be handled nicely without depending on third party extensions.
Bootstrap Package is built for >= 7.6 and comes with a fully configurable Frontend
via TypoScript. This includes the TypoScript Constant Editor.
