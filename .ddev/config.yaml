# This config.yaml was created with ddev version v1.7.1
# webimage: drud/ddev-webserver:v1.7.0
# dbimage: drud/ddev-dbserver:v1.7.0-10.2
# dbaimage: drud/phpmyadmin:v1.7.0
# bgsyncimage: drud/ddev-bgsync:v1.7.0
# However we do not recommend explicitly wiring these images into the
# config.yaml as they may break future versions of ddev.
# You can update this config.yaml using 'ddev config'.

# Key features of ddev's config.yaml:

# name: <projectname> # Name of the project, automatically provides
#   http://projectname.ddev.local and https://projectname.ddev.local

# type: <projecttype>  # drupal6/7/8, backdrop, typo3, wordpress, php

# docroot: <relative_path> # Relative path to the directory containing index.php.

# php_version: "7.1"  # PHP version to use, "5.6", "7.0", "7.1", "7.2", "7.3"

# You can explicitly specify the webimage, dbimage, dbaimage lines but this
# is not recommended, as the images are often closely tied to ddev's' behavior,
# so this can break upgrades.

# webimage: <docker_image>  # nginx/php docker image.
# dbimage: <docker_image>  # mariadb docker image.
# dbaimage: <docker_image>
# bgsyncimage: <docker_image>

# router_http_port: <port>  # Port to be used for http (defaults to port 80)
# router_https_port: <port> # Port for https (defaults to 443)

# xdebug_enabled: false  # Set to true to enable xdebug and "ddev start" or "ddev restart"

# webserver_type: nginx-fpm  # Can be set to apache-fpm or apache-cgi as well

# additional_hostnames:
#  - somename
#  - someothername
# would provide http and https URLs for "somename.ddev.local"
# and "someothername.ddev.local".

# additional_fqdns:
#  - example.com
#  - sub1.example.com
# would provide http and https URLs for "example.com" and "sub1.example.com"
# Please take care with this because it can cause great confusion.

# upload_dir: custom/upload/dir
# would set the destination path for ddev import-files to custom/upload/dir.

# working_dir:
#   web: /var/www/html
#   db: /home
# would set the default working directory for the web and db services.
# These values specify the destination directory for ddev ssh and the
# directory in which commands passed into ddev exec are run.

# omit_containers: ["dba", "ddev-ssh-agent"]
# would omit the dba (phpMyAdmin) and ddev-ssh-agent containers. Currently
# only those two containers can be omitted here.
# Note that these containers can also be omitted globally in the
# ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml or with the "ddev config global" command.

# host_webserver_port: "59001"
# The host port binding for the ddev-webserver can be explicitly specified. It is
# dynamic unless otherwise specified.
# This is not used by most people, most people use the *router* instead
# of the localhost port.

# host_db_port: "59002"
# The host port binding for the ddev-dbserver can be explicitly specified. It is dynamic
# unless explicitly specified.


# provider: default # Currently either "default" or "pantheon"
#
# Many ddev commands can be extended to run tasks after the ddev command is
# executed.
# See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extending-commands/ for more
# information on the commands that can be extended and the tasks you can define
# for them. Example:
#hooks:
#  post-start:
#    - exec: composer install -d /var/www/html
